            Ah, the login page—the digital bouncer that insists it’s you who forgot the password, even though you know
            it’s lying. You enter your carefully crafted, meticulously memorized password, only for the login page to
            stare back blankly, like it’s never seen you before. 'Invalid login,' it says. Invalid? It’s not like it’s
            asking for your high school locker combo! So, you give it another shot, slower this time, feeling like
            you’re hand-feeding a suspicious cat. Nope. At this point, it feels personal. Maybe this isn’t a login
            page—it’s a test of your patience, your memory, and your willingness to type 'password$123' 37 times while
            questioning all your life choices. When you finally get it, there’s a moment of blissful triumph, but it’s
            instantly soured by the realization that it took a team effort between you and your brain’s last three
            active neurons. Congratulations, you’re in… only to get an alert reminding you it’s time to change that
            password again! Oh, login page, forever the gatekeeper of every forgotten password, every mistyped key, and
            every ounce of dignity we have left online.</p>
