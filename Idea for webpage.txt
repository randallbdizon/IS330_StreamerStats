Idea for webpage:

- Login splash page to create user or to log in.
- If logged in, determine if user is part of the group
  - If user is part of the group, allow update options in Project page.
    - Determine that through back-end in DB.
  - If user is not part of group, give option to skip password screen and only allow view Project page.
